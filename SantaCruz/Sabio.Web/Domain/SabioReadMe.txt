This folder will contain the forth type of Models. > Domain Models

These models will not have any suffixes. They will have simple names that represent the entities 
that we are building our application arround.

If you intend to create this entity, you must fully hydrate all the properties.

Do not use these classes unless you intend to pass back all the data.
