Naming conventions
------------------------------------------

Although it is generally not a good idea and sometimes frowned upon, while in training please use descriptive
names even though they may be redundant (ie UsersIndex.cshtml vs Index.cshtml, EventCreate.cshtml vs Create.cshtml)

**Reminder, the files names are NOT directly linked to the Route Patter so you do not have to have this ugly name in the Url.
